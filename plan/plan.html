<h2>Goals</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The goals of this site is to share the IT related knowledge to audience by posting the articles regularly. These articles will be about to not only up to date issues but also basic or core knowledge for getting into the next level by discussing both in detail and in general. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The way of evaluting the success of the site is different from one another based on their goals of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">According to the goals of this site, the success of this site can be indicate by numbers such as the growth of vistor number from day to day, the number of sharing the articles from this site in social medias, the number of supscribers for getting newsletters and getting positive feedback on articles from audience.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This site is targetted to two type of audiences.The first type is someone who want to know or get the overall knowledge about the topic that is new for them and the second type is the one who want to extend the knowledge about the topic that they already learned or want to know the detail on specific part of that issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As the audience is seperated by their experience on a topic, there is no limit in age, gender and education level.&nbsp; Therefore, they could be from someone who are working in IT or IT related field to student or senior citizen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am going to make the look and feel of the site is as simple and clean as possible as it is used to give information or knowledge to visitors. Which can be done by using only few color combination in the whole site.</p>
